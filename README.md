The reimagined Power Glove enhances human-computer interaction by introducing a touchless interface that translates intuitive hand gestures into precise digital input. Designed to replace the traditional mouse, it enables seamless control through natural motion, offering a more ergonomic, immersive, and futuristic method of interaction. Users can simply connect the glove to their computer via Bluetooth and control it using hand movements. The glove tracks hand motion to move the cursor and detects gestures to trigger commands such as click, zoom, scroll, and more.

The system integrates an accelerometer/gyroscope IMU to track hand movement and orientation on three axes. Flex sensors embedded in each finger detect varying degrees of flexion, which, when combined with motion and orientation data, enable functions such as clicking, dragging, zooming, scrolling, and activating a laser pointer. Additional buttons on the glove provide quick access to common keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. The Adafruit Feather nrf52840 Sense microcontroller was used for its processing speed, bluetooth LE, and usb charging capabilities.

# For Windows and Linux

1. Download Arduino IDE at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. Start Arduino IDE and go to preference and add https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json as an 'Additional Board Manager URL'
3. Restart the IDE
4. Open Board Manager in the Tools -> Board and install 'Adafruit nRF52 by Adafruit'
5. After install use Tools -> Board to select Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense 

# For Windows Only

Windows Users will likely need to install the following two links
Select all options when installing below
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-ide-setup/windows-driver-installation
CP210x Windows Drivers option is what I had to choose
https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads

# For Linux Only 

Follow above windows steps and then follow below if python3 is not installed already

Linux Users will likely need to install https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers

1. Run `$ sudo apt-get install python3`
2. Run `$ pip3 install --user adafruit-nrfutil`
3. Add to path if needed
4. Ensure adafruit-nrfutil can be executed in terminal by running `$ adafruit-nrfutil version`
